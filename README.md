## Description üìÑ

In this activity, you will be building off of the CLI navigation commands you learned in the previous activity while adding onto that knowledge by exploring basic CLI (Command-Line Interface) file manipulation commands. You‚Äôll learn how to create files, move, copy, and delete files and directories using commands like `touch`, `mv`, `cp`, and `rm`.

By the end of this exercise, you should feel confident using these commands to manage files and directories in a command-line environment.

## Expected Project Structure üèóÔ∏è

```plaintext
cli_file_manipulation/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ example.txt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ backup/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ copy_example.txt
```

# Instructions ‚úÖ

## 1. **Create the Project Folder**
   - [ ] Navigate to the Home Directory
   - [ ] Create a folder named `cli_file_manipulation` to store all your project files:

```bash
mkdir cli_file_manipulation
```

**Explanation:**
- `mkdir cli_file_manipulation` creates a new directory named `cli_file_manipulation`.

## 2. **Navigate into the Project Folder**
   - [ ] Change your working directory to the newly created `cli_file_manipulation` directory:

```bash
cd cli_file_manipulation
```

**Explanation:**
- `cd cli_file_manipulation` changes the current directory to `cli_file_manipulation`.

## 3. **Open the Directory in Visual Studio Code**
   - [ ] Open your `cli_file_manipulation` directory in Visual Studio Code by using the following command:

```bash
code .
```

**Explanation:**
- `code .` opens the current directory (`cli_file_manipulation`) in Visual Studio Code. If VS Code is not installed, this command will not work, and you may need to install it or open the directory manually.

## 4. **Create an Example File**
   - [ ] Create a new text file named `example.txt` using the `touch` command:

```bash
touch example.txt
```

**Explanation:**
- `touch example.txt` creates an empty file named `example.txt` in the current directory.

## 5. **Add Content to the File**
   - [ ] Open the `example.txt` file and add the following content:

```plaintext
This is an example file for CLI file manipulation practice.
```

**Explanation:**
- Open the file inside of VS Code and manually add the text for demo.

## 6. **Copy the File**
   - [ ] Copy the `example.txt` file to create a new file named `copy_example.txt` using the `cp` command:

```bash
cp example.txt copy_example.txt
```

**Explanation:**
- `cp example.txt copy_example.txt` creates a copy of `example.txt` and names it `copy_example.txt`.

## 7. **Move the Copied File**
   - [ ] Move the `copy_example.txt` file to a new directory named `backup`:

```bash
mkdir backup
mv copy_example.txt backup/
```

**Explanation:**
- `mkdir backup` creates a new directory named `backup`.
- `mv copy_example.txt backup/` moves the copied file into the `backup` directory.

## 8. **List the Contents of the Directory**
   - [ ] List the contents of the `backup` directory to verify that the file was moved successfully:

```bash
ls backup/
```

**Explanation:**
- `ls backup/` lists the contents of the `backup` directory, showing that `copy_example.txt` is now in this directory.

## 9. **Delete the Original File**
   - [ ] Delete the original `example.txt` file using the `rm` command:

```bash
rm example.txt
```

**Explanation:**
- `rm example.txt` deletes the `example.txt` file from the current directory.

## 10. **Delete the Backup Directory**
   - [ ] Delete the `backup` directory and its contents using the `rm -rf` command:

```bash
rm -rf backup
```

**Explanation:**
- `rm -rf backup` recursively deletes the `backup` directory and all its contents. The `-rf` is required to delete directories.

##

**Great job! You‚Äôve successfully used basic CLI commands to manipulate files and directories.**

# Conclusion üìÑ

In this activity, you learned how to perform basic file manipulation tasks in the command line using commands like `touch`, `mv`, `cp`, and `rm`. These commands are fundamental for managing files and directories efficiently in a terminal environment. Mastering these will improve your workflow and prepare you for more advanced CLI operations in the future.
